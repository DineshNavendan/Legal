**YOU AND FLIXXO HEREBY AGREE AS FOLLOWS:

1.	Flixxo Platform

1.1.	Flixxo is a decentralized platform (the “Flixxo Platform”) aimed at developing an economy on top of a distributed video distribution network that leverages the Ethereum blockchain to provide a decentralized payment and incentive framework. The Platform will handle a video distribution ecosystem based on rules that have been determined by both (i) the Platform’s general infrastructure and (ii) the specific requirements of the relevant user.

1.2.	For a more detailed description of the proposed Flixxo Platform, please refer to

1.2.1.a)	the Flixxo website at https://www.flixxo.com/;

1.2.1.b)	the Flixxo Whitepaper (a copy of which can be found at 				https://www.flixxo.com/assets/docs/flixxo-white-paper_v0.5.pdf);(collectively referred to as the “Project Documentation”)

1.3.	The information contained in the Project Documentation is of descriptive nature only, is not binding and does not form part of these T&Cs.

2.	Scope of T&Cs

2.1.	Save as otherwise set out in these T&Cs, these T&Cs (including any terms incorporated herein by reference) govern only your contribution to Flixxo for the purchase of Flixx during the Contribution Period (as such terms are defined below).

2.2.	Any potential future use of Flixx in connection with the provision or receipt of services on the Flixxo Platform shall be subject to and governed by such other applicable terms, conditions and policies relating to the use of the Flixxo Platform (“Platform Terms”). Such Platform Terms will be made available to Flixxo Platform users, if the Flixxo Platform is successfully developed and deployed.

3.	Contribution Period

3.1.	Contributions may be made during a defined period of time (“Contribution Period”). The Contribution Period shall commence on 24 October 2017 and shall end on satisfaction of one of the following conditions (“Completion Conditions”) (whichever is the earlier):

4.	Creation and issue of Flixx through the Smart Contract System

4.1.	Flixxo has deployed a smart contract system (the “Smart Contract System”) on the Ethereum blockchain for the purposes of creating its own proprietary tokens (“Flixx”) and issuing such Flixx to the Contributor’s Ethereum wallet. Flixx shall be based on the ERC20 token standard and is intended to have the functionality set out in Schedule 1.

4.2.	The Smart Contract System shall be made available to receive contributions during the Contribution Period.

5.	Method of Contribution

5.1.	You may contribute to Flixxo during the Token Sale in the manner described in this clause 1.A.5.

The creation and issue of Flixx shall be initiated by the Contributor transferring an amount in ETH during the Contribution Period to the Smart Contract System, located on the Ethereum blockchain at the address to be published on http://www.flixxo.com when the Contribution Period commences. The Smart Contract System’s receipt of the contribution in Ether from the Contributor will trigger a smart contract operation whereby Flixx will be created and issued to the Ethereum wallet address from which the contribution was received.

5.3.	Contributions shall be sent exclusively to the Smart Contract System’s address specified on the Flixxo website in accordance with clause 1.A.5.2.. To the extent that any third-party website, service or smart-contract offers to receive contributions and issue Flixx or facilitates the allocation or transfer of Flixx in any way during the Contribution Period, such third-party websites or services are, unless expressly set out in these T&Cs or mentioned on the Flixxo website, not authorised by Flixxo nor do they have any legal or commercial relationship in any way with Flixxo, the Flixxo Platform or Flixx.

5.4.	The Smart Contract System shall only accept contributions that are made in ETH. The Smart Contract System will not accept any contributions made in fiat currencies or any crypto-currencies (other than ETH). Contributors that send contributions:

5.4.1.a)	in a fiat currency or any cryptocurrency other than ETH; or

5.5.	        In order to receive Flixx, Contributors must have an Ethereum wallet that supports the ERC20 token standard (in other words the Contributor’s Ethereum wallet must possess technical infrastructure that is compatible with the receipt, storage and transfer of Flixx, being tokens that are created based on the ERC20 token standard). Flixxo reserves the right to prescribe additional conditions relating to the specific wallet requirements at any time acting in its sole and absolute discretion.

5.6.	Subject to compliance with the foregoing provisions of this clause the creation and issue of Flixx through the Smart Contract System, and delivery of Flixx to the Contributor’s Ethereum wallet address shall be made approximately one month after conclusion of the Contribution Period.

6.	Flixx Price
The price per Flixx will be denominated in Ether and base price of Flixx shall be 0.00025 ETH = 1 Flixx but:

6.1.1.a)	Tier 1 contributors who participate in the first 24hs of the Token Sale (“Tier 1 Bonus Period”) will receive a 30% bonus in the number of Flixx (e.g. suppose 1 ETH = 4000 Flixx. During the Tier 1 Bonus Period, 1 ETH = 5200 Flixx);

6.1.1.b)	Tier 2 contributors who participate in the next 6 days after Tier 1 contributors (day 1 to 7 of ICO, “Tier 2 Bonus Period”), will receive a 25% bonus in the number of Flixx (e.g. suppose 1 ETH = 4000 Flixx. During the Tier 2 Bonus Period, 1 ETH =  5000 Flixx); and

6.1.1.c)	Tier 3 contributors who participate in the next 7 days after Tier 2 contributors (day 8 to 14 of the ICO, "Tier 3 Bonus Period"), will receive a 20% bonus in the number of Flixx (e.g. suppose 1 ETH = 4000 Flixx. During the Tier 3 Bonus Period, 1 ETH = 4800 Flixx); and

6.1.1.d)	Tier 4 contributors who participate in the next 7 days after Tier 3 contributors (day 15 to 21 of the ICO, "Tier 3 Bonus Period"), will receive a 15% bonus in the number of Flixx (e.g. suppose 1 ETH = 4000 Flixx. During the Tier 4 Bonus Period, 1 ETH = 4600 Flixx); and


6.1.1.e)	Tier 5 contributors who participate in the final 9 days (day 22 to 30 of ICO, “Tier 5 Bonus Period”), will receive a 10% bonus in the number of Flixx (e.g. suppose 1 ETH= 4000 Flixx. During the Tier 5 Bonus Period, 1 ETH = 4400 Flixx)]

7.	Refunds, Refusals, Suspension and Termination of Contributions

7.1.	Flixxo has imposed a minimum aggregate contribution target equivalent to 5,000 ETH (“Minimum Target”). If on conclusion of the Contribution Period, the aggregate sum of all contributions received by Flixxo is less than the Minimum Target, Flixxo shall, within a reasonable period of time, exercise reasonable endeavours to procure that contributions are returned to the Contributor.

7.2.	Flixxo reserves the right to refuse or reject any contributions made at any time in our sole and absolute discretion. To the extent that we refuse or reject a contribution, we will exercise reasonable endeavours to procure that the contribution is returned to the Contributor to the Ethereum wallet from which the contribution was made, however, we do not warrant, represent or offer any assurances that we will successfully be able to recover and/or return any such contributions.

7.3.	Subject to clauses  1.A.7.1 and 1.A.7.2 and except to the extent required by applicable law, all contributions received by Flixxo under these T&Cs are final and Contributors shall not be entitled to claim any refund or reimbursement of contributions from Flixxo.

7.4.	At any time prior to satisfaction of the Completion Conditions, Flixxo may either temporarily suspend or permanently abort the Token Sale for security reasons. Any suspension or abort of the Token Sale shall be deemed to commence from the moment that Flixxo publishes a notice to that effect on its website.

7.5.	During any period of suspension or in the event that the Contribution Period is aborted, the Smart Contract System will no longer be able to receive and accept contributions, create Flixx and/or issue Flixx to Contributors. Contributors who send us contributions (after we publish a notice that the Token Sale has been suspended or aborted in accordance with clause 1.A.7.4) risk losing their entire contribution and we shall not be responsible or liable for recovering or returning any such contributions to the Contributor nor shall we be responsible or liable for any losses incurred by the Contributor in this respect. Contributors are therefore strongly advised to check our website before sending a contribution to the Smart Contract System.

18.	Dispute Resolution by Arbitration

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CLAUSE CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS CERTAIN PROVISIONS, SUCH AS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. THIS CLAUSE REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH FLIXXO AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.

18.1.	Binding Arbitration. Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “Disputes”) in which either Party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Flixxo (i) waive your and Flixxo’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these T&Cs resolved in a court, and (ii) waive your and Flixxo’s respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and Flixxo agree to arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).

18.2.	No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions. Any Dispute arising out of or related to these T&Cs is personal to you and Flixxo and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.

18.3.	Arbitration Rules. The enforceability of this clause 1.A.18 will be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the International Chamber of Commerce Rules of Arbitration, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

18.4.	Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution. Each Party will notify the other Party in writing of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the Parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Flixxo shall be sent by e-mail to info@flixxo.com Notice to you shall be sent to any address you provide to us in writing in a notice. Your notice must include (i) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (ii) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (iii) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and Flixxo cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date that the notice is received by the applicable Party, then either you or Flixxo may, as appropriate and in accordance with this clause 1.A.18, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in clause 1.A.18.1, file a claim in court.
  
18.5.	Process. Any arbitration will occur in Gibraltar. The arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator appointed by the Gibraltar Chamber of Commerce in accordance with the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce Rules of Arbitration, which are hereby incorporated by reference.  The courts located in Gibraltar will have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration decision.
   
18.6.	Authority of Arbitrator. These T&Cs, the applicable International Chamber of Commerce Rules of Arbitration and the arbitrator will have (i) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (ii) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative or class action, which is prohibited by these T&Cs. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
 
18.7.	Arbitration Rules. The International Chamber of Commerce Rules of Arbitration and additional information about International Chamber of Commerce are available at https://iccwbo.org/dispute-resolution-services/arbitration/rules-of-arbitration. By agreeing to be bound by these T&Cs, you either (i) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the International Chamber of Commerce Rules of Arbitration, or (ii) waive your opportunity to read the International Chamber of Commerce Rules of Arbitration and any claim that the International Chamber of Commerce Rules of Arbitration are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

18.8.	Severability of Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Provisions. If any term, clause or provision of this clause 1.A.18 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent applicable and required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this clause 1.A.18 will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in clause 1.A.18.2 above are severable from the other provisions of these T&Cs and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.

19.	Miscellaneous

19.1.	The Contributor understands and accepts that the network of miners will ultimately be in control of the Smart Contract System and that a majority of these miners could agree at any point to make changes to the official Smart Contract System and to run a new version of the Smart Contract System. Such a scenario could lead to Flixx losing intrinsic value.

**SCHEDULE 1

**INTENDED FUNCTIONALITY OF Flixx

Activity in the Flixxo Platform is intended to be performed primarily using Flixx. Flixx’s principal purpose is therefore to operate as an ‘in-app currency’.

At the protocol level, tokens are required as an incentive for distributors to store and share content to users. Tokens are also awarded to content producers for each download. At the application level, tokens are used to reward any behaviour that token holders consider worthy, like generating content reviews or relevant comments.

Additional functionality may be provided by other smart contracts, like for example the ability to freeze tokens as a means of warranty to prevent spam or inappropriate content.

[Although services can be acquired on the Flixxo Platform in fiat currency, users will be incentivised to use Flixx as there will be lower transaction fees and rewards for transacting in Flixx].

The intention is to create an internal economy within the Flixxo Platform, whereby Flixx will be an integral part which drives this ecosystem. Flixx will therefore continuously circulate within the Flixxo ecosystem, passing from one user to another as a means of consideration for the acquisition of goods/services.

Tied-in to the “in-app currency” functionality, Flixx will be used to reward users and participants of the Flixxo Platform for contributing to its development, success and growth.

It is envisaged that 900,000,000 Flixx will be created. 200,000,000 Flixx will be sold during the Token Sale and 700,000,000 Flixx will be retained in the smart contract with predefined withdrawal conditions as follows:

〈	100,000,000 Flixx will remain on hands of the development team and partners, vested proportionally on two years.

〈	100,000,000 Flixx will remain with the Company in order to cover the costs of the Token Sale and for future partnerships with content providers.

〈	500,000,000 will be distributed in a predefined and regulated manner, and set up into a smart contract that will allocate Flixx in automatically in the form of incentives to attract users and producers into the Flixxo Platform. Those incentives will decrease to zero along the first five years and the remaining Flixx after this period will be given away in different reward programs to be defined by the Company to users who join the Flixxo Platform.
The following non-exhaustive list of activities is indicative of how rewards might be earned on the Flixxo Platform:

19.9.1.a)	Video production, distribution or other generation of content on the Flixxo Platform;

19.9.1.b)	Generation or dissemination of reviews on content and/or providing commentary on such content;

19.9.1.c)	helping to register new users who provide services or use services offered by other users;

19.9.1.d)	providing reliable and trusted ratings which contribute to a user’s reputation on the Flixxo Platform;

19.9.1.e)	engaging in activity on the Flixxo Platform (such as buying a service from another user) that results in the exchange of Flixx between users;
19.9.1.f)	providing support to other users by guiding them through the Flixxo Platform utility and helping them establish a presence on the network;
19.9.1.g)	providing assistance to the community by supporting the creation of new features/tools and facilitating the future enhancement of the Flixxo Platform;
19.9.1.h)	running community forums and providing responses to questions raised by other users;
19.9.1.i)	reviewing a user’s activity on the Flixxo Platform and providing feedback on the validity/legality of their services; and
19.9.1.j)	any other behaviour that either the Company at its sole discretion (either in consultation with the Flixx token holders or of its own initiative) considers worthy.

Flixx is not intended to have functionality or utility outside the Flixxo Platform. The Flixxo Platform will therefore be structured as a “closed system” insofar as the use of Flixx is concerned.

**POSSIBILITY OF CHANGE TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF FLIXX

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF UNDERTAKING A LEGAL AND REGULATORY ANALYSIS OF THE FUNCTIONALITY OF FLIXX. FOLLOWING THE CONCLUSION OF THIS ANALYSIS, WE MAY DECIDE TO AMEND THE INTENDED FUNCTIONALITY OF FLIXX IN ORDER TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH ANY LEGAL OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT. WE SHALL PUBLISH A NOTICE ON OUR WEBSITE OF ANY CHANGES THAT WE DECIDE TO MAKE TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF FLIXX AND IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REGULARLY CHECK OUR WEBSITE FOR ANY SUCH NOTICES. ON THE CONLCUSION OF THIS ANALYSIS, WE WILL DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO CHANGE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF FLIXX. CONSEQUENTLY, YOU MAY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES BE ENTITLED TO CLAIM A REFUND OF YOUR CONTRIBUTION FROM US IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE T&Cs ON SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS FLIXXO MAY PRESCRIBE IN ITS REFUND POLICY WHICH SHALL BE MADE AVAILABLE ON ITS WEBSITE.

THE COMPANY MAKES NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO FLIXX, INCLUDING ANY (i) WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY; (ii) WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE; (iii) WARRANTY OF TITLE; OR (iv) WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF A THIRD PARTY; WHETHER ARISING BY LAW, COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, USAGE OF TRADE, OR OTHERWISE. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, CONTRIBUTOR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS NOT RELIED UPON ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE BY THE COMPANY, OR ANY OTHER PERSON ON THE COMPANY'S BEHALF.

**SCHEDULE 2

**RISK FACTORS

1.	Risk of software weaknesses: because Flixx, the Smart Contract System and the Flixxo Platform are based on the Ethereum protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum protocol may have a material adverse effect on Flixx, the Smart Contract System and/or the Flixxo Platform. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to the Flixx (including the utility of Flixx for obtaining services), the Smart Contract System and/or the Flixxo Platform, by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum protocol. The Smart Contract System concept, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) is still in an early development stage and unproven. There is no warranty or assurance that the process for creating Flixx will be uninterrupted or error-free and why there is an inherent risk that the software could contain defects, weaknesses, vulnerabilities, viruses or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of contributions and/or Flixx.

1.	Regulatory risk: blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of the Smart Contract System and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications to the Smart Contract System and/or the Flixxo Platform, including its termination and the loss of Flixx for the Contributor. Additionally, regulation of proposed activities of the Flixxo Platform is currently uncertain. It is not known what regulatory framework the proposed Flixxo Platform and associated activities will be caught by, the nature and obligations that will be imposed on Flixxo in order to comply with any such regulatory framework or when/if Flixxo will even be able to apply to be regulated, or successfully obtain the necessary licences so that it may lawfully carry out its proposed business activities.  

2.	Risks associated with uncertain regulations and enforcement actions: the regulatory status of Flixx and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions.  It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory authorities may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications, including the Flixxo Platform and Flixx.  It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any legislative or regulatory authorities may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Flixxo Platform and Flixx.  Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Flixxo Platform and Flixx in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that Flixx are a regulated financial instrument that requires registration or licensing.  Flixxo may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.  

3.	Risk of abandonment / lack of success: the creation and issue of Flixx and the development of the Flixxo Platform may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects). There is no assurance that, even if the Flixxo Platform is partially or fully developed and launched, you will receive any benefits through Flixx that you hold.

4.	Risk associated with other applications: the Flixxo Platform may give rise to other, alternative projects, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which Flixx will have no intrinsic value.

5.	Risks associated with markets for Flixx: the Company may not enable or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of Flixx. This may restrict the contemplated avenues for using Flixx to within the Flixxo Platform, and could therefore create illiquidity risk with respect to any Flixx you own. Even if secondary trading of Flixx is facilitated by third-party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that third parties do ascribe an external exchange value to Flixx (e.g. as denominated in a crypto or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero. If you are purchasing the Flixx as a form of investment on a speculative basis or otherwise, or for a financial purpose, with the expectation or desire that their inherent, intrinsic or cash-equivalent value may increase with time, you assume all risks associated with such speculation or actions, and any errors associated therewith, and accept that the Flixx are not offered by the Company or its affiliates on an investment basis. You further acknowledge that any funds you consider to be invested in the Company, the Flixxo Platform or the Flixx will not be protected, guaranteed or reimbursed by any governmental, regulatory or other entity, and will not, for instance be guaranteed by the Gibraltar Deposit Guarantee Scheme, the Gibraltar Investor Compensation Scheme, and is unlikely to be protected by any equivalent scheme in a jurisdiction outside of Gibraltar.

6.	Risk of losing access to tokens due to loss of private key(s), custodial error or your error: Flixx can only be accessed by using an Ethereum wallet with a combination of the Contributor’s account information (address), private key and password. The private key is encrypted with a password. You acknowledge, understand and accept that if your private key or password gets lost or stolen, the obtained Flixx associated with your Ethereum wallet address may be unrecoverable and permanently lost. Additionally, any third party that gains access to your private key, including by gaining access to the login credentials relating to your Ethereum wallet, may be able to misappropriate your Flixx. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store Flixx, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your Flixx.

7.	Risk of theft: the Smart Contract System concept, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing.  Any such successful attacks could result in theft or loss of contributions or Flixx, adversely impacting the ability to develop the Flixxo Platform and derive any usage or functionality from Flixx. Furthermore, because the Flixxo Platform is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Flixxo team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or defects into the core infrastructure of the Flixxo Platform, which could negatively affect the Flixxo Platform and Flixx.   

8.	Risk of Ethereum mining attacks: as with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Smart Contract System is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and rare condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Smart Contract System, expected proper execution and sequencing of token transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations. You understand and accept that the network of miners will ultimately be in control of the delivery of the Flixx via the Smart Contract System, and that a majority of miners could agree at any point to make changes, updates, modifications to, or effect a deletion or destruction of the Smart Contract System, and that such a scenario could lead to the Flixx losing intrinsic value and/or functionality.

9.	Risk of incompatible wallet service: the wallet or wallet service provider used to receive Flixx must to conform to the ERC20 token standard in order to be technically compatible with Flixx. The failure to ensure such conformity may have the result that Contributor will not gain access to his Flixx.

10.	Risk of hard-fork: the Flixxo Platform will need to go through substantial development works as part of which it may become the subject of significant conceptual, technical and commercial changes before release. As part of the development, an upgrade to Flixx may be required (hard-fork of Flixx) and that, if you decide not to participate in such upgrade, you may no longer be able to use your Flixx and any non-upgraded Flixx may lose its functionality in full.

11.	Risk of uninsured losses: unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, Flixx are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them.  Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by us, to offer recourse to you.

12.	Risks arising from taxation: the tax characterization of Flixx is uncertain.  You must seek your own tax advice in connection with acquisition, storage, transfer and use of Flixx, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including, without limitation, withholding taxes, transfer taxes, value added taxes, income taxes and similar taxes, levies, duties or other charges and tax reporting requirements.

13.	Risk of an unfavourable fluctuation of Ethereum and other currency value: Flixxo intends to use the contributions received to fund the development of the Flixxo Platform and various other operating expenses. The contributions received will be denominated in ETH, and may be converted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies. If the value of ETH or other currencies fluctuates unfavourably during or after the Contribution Period, Flixxo may not be able to fund the development of, or may not be able to maintain, the Flixxo Platform in the manner that it intended.

14.	Risk of dissolution of the Company or network: it is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavourable fluctuation in the value of ETH (or other cryptographic and fiat currencies), decrease in Flixx utility due to negative adoption of the Flixxo Platform, the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Flixxo Platform may no longer be viable to operate and the Company may dissolve.

15.	Risks arising from lack of governance rights: because Flixx confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Flixxo Platform or Flixxo, all decisions involving the Flixxo Platform or Flixxo will be made by Flixxo acting in its sole and absolute discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue the Flixxo Platform, to create and issue more Flixx, or to sell or liquidate Flixxo.  These decisions could adversely affect the Flixxo Platform and/or Flixx you hold.

16.	Risks arising from the video sharing and content streaming market: the video sharing and content streaming market, and by extension the Flixxo Platform, is subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations, including those with respect to employment rights,  KYC/AML and customer due diligence procedures, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, data security, and others. These laws and regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting the Flixxo Platform could be enacted, which could impact the utility of Flixx in the Flixxo Platform. Additionally, the Flixxo Platform users are subject to or may be adversely affected by industry specific laws and regulations or licensing requirements. If any of these parties fails to comply with any of these licensing requirements or other applicable laws or regulations, or if such laws and regulations or licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise expanded, it could adversely impact the Flixxo Platform and the Flixx, including its functionality to obtain or provide services within the Flixxo Platform.

17.	Risks associated with the development and maintenance of the Flixxo Platform: the Flixxo Platform is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although we intend for the Flixx and Flixxo Platform to function as described in Schedule 1, and intend to take commercially reasonable steps toward those ends, we may have to make changes to the specifications of the Flixx or the Flixxo Platform for any number of legitimate reasons. Moreover, we have no control over how other participants will use the Flixxo Platform, what products or services will be offered through the Flixxo Platform by third parties, or how third-party products and services will utilize Flixx (if at all). This could create the risk that the Flixx or Flixxo Platform, as further developed and maintained, may not meet your expectations at the time of purchase. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and participate in the Flixxo Platform, it is still possible that the Flixxo Platform will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the Flixxo Platform and Flixx, and the potential utility of the Flixx, including the utility of the Flixx for obtaining services and/or offering rewards and/or being used in the manner intended at the time of the Token Sale.

18.	Risk of Competing Platforms: It is possible that alternative platforms could be established that utilize the same open source code and protocol underlying the Flixxo Platform and attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the services offered by or within the Flixxo Platform. The Flixxo Platform may compete with these alternatives, which could negatively impact the Flixxo Platform and Flixx, including the utility of the Flixx for obtaining services offered by or within the Flixxo Platform.

19.	Unanticipated Risks: cryptographic tokens such as Flixx are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks set out in this Schedule 2, there are other risks associated with your acquisition, storage, transfer and use of Flixx, including those that Flixxo may not be able to anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks set out in this Schedule 2.
