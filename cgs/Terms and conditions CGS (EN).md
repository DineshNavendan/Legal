Participants of this Platform are able to create a decentralized escrow to hold the funds raised in their own **Token Sale** as **ICO Launchers**; to open a claim to withdraw their correspondent remained ethers, as **ICO Token Holders**; or to vote on an open claim to decide whether ICO token holders are enabled to withdraw the remained ethers in the escrow or not, as **CGS Token Holders** or **arbiters**.

By using CGS, as ICO Launcher, ICO token holder, or CGS token holder, including by simply navigating through the website, you agree that you and any person you allow to access the Platform through your account, will abide by this Terms and Conditions (the “Agreement”), which is set forth in its entirety below. 

This Agreement is between **you** and **Governance System Platform Ltd.** (hereinafter, **we**, **CGS**, the **Platform** or the **Company**). This Agreement sets the conditions of your access to the Platform and use the Services and websites offered by the Company (the “Services”). Your access to and use of the Services are subject to your acceptance of and compliance with this Agreement. For more information, see Section Functioning of the Services.

Specific or technical terms used herein are defined in Section Definitions of this Agreement.

This Agreement sets forth terms on which ICO Launchers interact with ICO token holders and CGS token holders through the Platform.

**ICO LAUNCHERS**: If you are an ICO Launcher, you could upload information about your project, such as your business plan, token features, roadmap, team info, among others to our Platform https://cgs.vote - The “Site". You can also deploy CGS smart contract to create a decentralized escrow for the capital raised through an Initial Coin Offering. The deploy of CGS smart contracts requires a deposit of a certain amount of CGS tokens, that will be determined in the Site. Accepting this Term and Conditions you should understand that you are opening the possibility that ICO token holders can proportionaly withdraw the remained funds deposited in the CGS escrow.

**ICO Token Holders**: As ICO token holder, you may participate in the Coin Governance System of every project using this methodology through the Platform, by opening a claim to withdraw remained funds in a CGS escrow or by withdrawing the remained funds in a CGS escrow.

**CGS Token Holders** (also called arbiters). As CGS token holder, you can decide if an ICO project using the CGS should activate "withdraw mode" or not (voting KO or OK), by depositing CGS tokens in the CGS smart contract. The result of the voting would be determined by simple majority (more than 50 percent), but if there is a tie, OK shal be deemed as the winner result. As CGS token holder you understand that a percentage of the CGS tokens deposited in the voting will be transferred from the CGS token holders that holds the looser vote to the winners. That percentage will be determined in the Site.

**GENERAL USERS**: Certain parts of the Site will be visible to users who have not signed up. Those users, nevertheless, are bound by this Agreement.

### 2. <a name="definitions">**Definitions**</a>

#### A. “Blockchain” means a distributed ledger, made of chains of data blocks designed to avoid the possibility of modification. Once a data item has been time-stamped by a participant that is trustworthy it is itself connected to a previous block. For this reason, it is especially suitable to store data organized in time eliminating the possibility of modification or revision. There are several aspects involved in the process:

•	Data storage: It is achieved through the replication of the blockchain.

•	Data transmission: It is achieved through peer-to-peer.

•	Data confirmation: It is achieved through a consensus process among all the participating nodes. The type of algorithm that is most often used is the one that provides a “proof-of-work”, where there is an open, transparent and competitive process to validate the new blockchain block, referred to as “mining”.
